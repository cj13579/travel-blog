Hi all,

We have just arrived in cambodia after 3 days in Bangkok. What a hectic city, especially the traffic! I&#8217;m not sure whether or not Thai people have a problem counting or seeing but when there are clearly 2 lanes, as if by magic the Thais found a third and sometimes a fourth. Furthermore, if all of the lanes (real or imaginary) are full, they are more than comfortable driving on the wrong side of the road!

We had a very busy 3 days. We stayed in a guest house just off Koh San road which was nice but basic. We were very cultured tourists during the day visiting a number of Temples, museums and generally exploring the city. In the evening we dabbled in Bangkok&#8217;s notorious night life and sampled copious amounts of street food and local beverages (Chang beer).

We had an early start to today (4.30am) to get to Mo Chit bus station for our 6am bus to the Thai &#8211; Cambodian border. We had a bit of a nightmare of a morning, not only did Katie lose her newly purchased $3.00 handbag but we were almost scammed out of 2,400baht (50pounds &#8211; a lot in these parts) for fake visas which our Tuk-Tuk driver had taken us to at the border, luckily we sussed it just in time and proceeded to buy a real visa at the real border.

We did however make it to Cambodia after sharing a Taxi with some geriatric backpackers (Jack and Barbara). We are now in Siem Reap and have got to know the place by cycling around &#8211; pretty scary on these roads but we got the hang of it pretty quick! So far, we are really enjoying Cambodia the people are friendly, the food and beer is good and the town is relaxing. Tomorrow we have another early start (4.15) as we are going to Angkor Wat for the sunrise.

We are having a really good time, the weather has been well over 30 during the day and dropping to about 25 during the night. We feel as though we are getting used to this travelling lark (forgetting this morning)! The only shame of it is that the locals are so poor that they hassle you all the time whether it be for an overpriced Tuk-Tuk or a child begging. They can spot the tourists a mile off &#8211; and we don&#8217;t exactly blend in!!

Anyway, we are all well and having a great time. Hope all is well with everyone at home &#8211; subscribe or keep checking for more posts. We are uploading photos now!

Speak soon, lots of love

Chris and Katie
