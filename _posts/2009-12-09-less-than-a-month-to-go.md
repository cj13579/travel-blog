The countdown has really begun now! Slowly but surely it seems that we are getting somewhere with all the planning and organising and I think that bar actually getting some bits a pieces (which hopefully Santa will be bringing) we are pretty much ready to go.

One thing that we are in the process of doing is booking accommodation for some of our destinations when we arrive late/have had super long travels and won&#8217;t really be in the mood to hunt about for deals.Â  If anyone knows of any good, cheap places to stay in any of the places that we plan on visiting (see pages) then please get in contact!
