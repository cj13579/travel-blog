Hi guys,

We took a boat down to Chau Doc via the Mekong Delta and met two awesome guys, a brit and an aus called Crunky and Staf who were CYCLING round south east asia-the crazy things. We went for a drink with them that afternoon and then went for some food and then they introduced us to Bia Hoi, a self brew kind of set up where you can buy 2 litres of the stuff for the equivalent of 30p. Apparently there are a few round vietnam!

The next morning we went to the floating market and also got taken to a fish farm by a boat. It was pretty small and disappointing a bit like Chau Doc itself however we were glad we went as we met the two guys who live in Brisbane and we will go and visit when we head there.

We then moved on to Ho Chi Minh City in what turned out to be the most crazy 7 hour bus journey ever. It included live chickens, boxes of fish and a lot more people than seats. Chris had a lovely guy sat next to him with horrible cut hands who kept falling asleep on his shoulder and then I ended up with a fat lady next to me who was practically sat on me as we were already trying to fit too many people into the seats! We were glad to arrive and after 9 days of noodles and rice I was soooo glad to find a place which served me an AMAZING spag bol!!! Heaven! The next day we hit the toursit sights again visting the reunification palace and the war remnants  museum. We had an awesome tour at the palace which gave us a good insight to Vietnamese history. We also sorted out a bus which takes us from here to Nha Trang, then Hoi an then Hue and finally Hanoi whenever we want and we can take night buses so our transport in Vietnam is now sorted. 

Today we headed to the Cu chi tunnels which were awesome and gave us more history! The guides english was not quite so good but better than my Vietnamese so we understood bits and the documentary video at the start had already given us an insight!

Tonight we head off on our first night bus to Nha Trang! There are nice beaches there apparently so maybe a few chilled days here is what we need!

Still having an awesome time! Hope the snow has cleared and everyone is ok back home.

Keep the comments coming-we like to hear that you&#8217;re all ok and what you&#8217;re up to too!!

lots of love

Chris and Katie
