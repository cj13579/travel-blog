Hi Everyone,

Just to let you know that we have put our final NZ pictures up. However, they are on page 1 of the NZ Album because our camera has reset it´s numbering system now we have reached 9999 photos!!

We are in Peru at the moment and are currently in Lima. Tomorrow we head south though towards Pisco. It is a bit of a shock living out of a bag again and our Spanish (or lack thereof) is proving to be somewhat of a barrier. Needless to say, we are learning (we have to!) and are getting on well.

More pictures and posts to come soon.

Hope everyone is well back home.

Chris and Katie
