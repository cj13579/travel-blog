Hi guys,

Just to let you know that you dont need to register to read the posts, look at our photo&#8217;s and videos or read comments  but if you want to be able to leave comments or recieve our posts via email then you will need to register.

This is hopefully quite straight forward &#8211; on the right of this page under MEMBERS there should be an option to register. Just click there and follow the instructions and it will send you a password. Note this email often ends up in junk mail so check there if it does&#8217;t arrive in your inbox.When you first log in it will take you to &#8220;your profile&#8221; which is a page where you can change your password, profile information and other settings. Once you have completed these go back to the normal site by clicking on the &#8220;visit site&#8221; button at the top of the screen next to where it says Chris and Katie&#8217;s Travel Blog. Every other time you want to log in can just enter your username and password on the right under MEMBERS &#8211; and away you go!  To leave a comment about a particular post, simply click on the title of that post and scroll down to the bottom of the page &#8211; simples!

Once you have logged in you can subscribe to our post update service which will send you an email everytime we post something new. To do this from the site click on &#8220;Dashboard&#8221; under &#8220;Members&#8221; then from the menu called &#8220;Profile&#8221; on the left and click &#8220;Subscriptions&#8221;. From here you can select what type of email to receive (extract or full post &#8211; the default is full post) and you can select which catagories you wish to subscribe to &#8211; just Katie&#8217;s posts or just Chris&#8217;s or all. Again to get back to the site use the visit site button at the top.

Enjoy the site!

Lots of love

Chris and Katie
