Hi,

This post is going to be short as we have limited time. Apologies for not being in touch for a while but internet in Austrailia is expensive and not as easy to find as in Asia-and we seem to be really busy. Anyway we&#8217;ve made it safely and are loving austrailia.

Since I last wrote we got back to Singapore and got shown around by this lovely guy called Hakim and his friends. They looked after us sooo well. We also went to Singapore zoo which was great and then Hakim came and picked us off to see us off at the airport, which just made us feel so looked after. Hopefully he is going to come with his friends to stay with us in England so we can return the hospitality.

We then flew into Sydney, which was a beautiful city. We saw the opera house, climbed the Sydney Harbour bridge which was cool and walked round the city including Darling Harbour and the botanical gardens. There are cockatoos and Ibis virds everywhere there! We also got taken out for an evening in Sydney with Ramesh, a friend of ours from Kids Klub which was awesome-so good to see him. We also picked up our campervan which is spotty and we love it! We drove down to Jervis Bay which was beautiful and we saw our first wild Kangaroo and Possoms. We then headed to Bondi Beach the next day which was cool and Ramesh came and took us out in Bondi-so good to know locals-especially when they are as nice and look after you as well as Ramesh!

The next day we drove up to the blue mountains which were stunning. Saw the 3 sisters and walked through the bush by wentworth waterfalls which was cool.

Yesterday was a driving bay, via myall lakes which were stunning-massive sand dunes there. We stopped at Port Macquarie where we got fish and chips, ate them by the sea at sunset and saw a few wild dolphins! They came out the water maybe only 8 times but it was still awesome. We also saw tonnes of pelicans and lorikeets (I think they are called parakeets in england-green parrots anyway).

Today we have driven up to Byron Bay and spent the afternoon on the beach.

Sooo much more too come. But to sum it up we&#8217;re still loving it but still missing all of you. Still really good to hear from you all so keep sending messages!!

Lots of love

Chris and Katie
