Hi everyone.

We&#8217;ve put some new photos up but there seems to be a few problems with some of the thumbnails. We will try to sort this out asap.

Hope you&#8217;re all well.

Miss you.

Katie and Chris

UPDATE: Chris is a Genius and has fixed the problem. However it is now dinner time so I will fill in the captions for you all soon! Lots of love xxx

UPDATE 2: Ok so I did that quicker than I expected. Chris wanted to watch Tottenham so I took the opportunity to update you all. Anyways bedtime for me! Take care xxx
