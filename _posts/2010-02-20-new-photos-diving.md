Hey all,

Just to let you all know that we have put a shed load of new photos up onto the site. The photos are from the second half of our time in Vietnam and the time that we spent in Laos. They are not more recent that the tigers etc, these are still to come.

While I am here, Katie and I finished our diving course today and our now fully qualified open water divers! During our course dives we had the pleasure of swimming with no less than 5 turtles, 4 black tip reef sharks, 2 leopard sharks, clownfish (or Nemos as Katie calls them), surgeon fish (or Dorys as Katie calls them), baracudas, trigger fish, angel fish, puffer fish, star fish, scorpion fish, every type of moray eel, box fish lion fish and countless other amazing creatures! It was, we both think, the most amazing thing that we have done to date.

Katie will proably elaborate on it more in our next proper post but I was really excited i had to mention it!!

Hope that you are all well

Chris and Katie
