Hi everyone,

So when we last updated you we were chilling out in Bonito for a couple of days before we carried on our travels.

So, after 2 very relaxing days in the sun by the pool we took a night bus down to Foz de Iguazu to go and visit the waterfalls there. Having met a lovely Dutch guy and a new zealand couple that we met in Bolivia, we shared a minibus that took us across the border to Puerto Iguazu in Argentina where we planned to start our waterfall adventure. We had been recommended by both fellow tracellers and the guide book that the falls are better from the Argentinian side but you have to visit both the Argentinian and the Brazillian. So that is what we would do.

But, things have to be prioritised. We were going to be in Argentina for 24 hours and would not be able to forgive ourselves if we left having not sampled the two things that this country is most famous for apart from football &#8211; Steak and Red wine. We asked our hostel reception for a suitable restaurant and his recommendation did not disappoint &#8211; it was delicious! What made it even better was that Cor (the lovely Dutch man) was feeling generous (or drunk) and wouldnt let us pay! After our long journey and equally big meal we were all shattered and decided to get an early night before our day of exploration of the Argentinian side of the falls.

The weather when we woke was not great, overcast with showers. Still we were determined not to be down heartened and set out for the falls. Wow &#8211;  there were hundreds! Well, 80 apparently, which were all large, wet and VERY noisy!

We explored for the whole day and at the end of the day decided to take a boat trip into the falls themselves. Needless to say by the end of it we were completely drenched! However, unlike everyone else who had soaking wet clothes, I had been the smart one. Before we left I stripped to my undies and stuffed all my nice warm, dry clothes into a dry bag so when we arrived back I simply slipped back into my nice warm clothes and was snug as a bug in a rug!

That evening we decided to head back over to the Brazillian side of the falls so that we could have a bit of a lie in before exploring the falls from the other side. We stayed in a nice place which had the most incredible breakfast which set us up perfectly for the day ahead.

Like the day before the weather was bad, if not worse. But the falls made up for that. You cant get as close to them as you can on the Argentinian side but somehow they just seem more impressive from Brazil. After a couple of hours of exploring we headed back, collected our things and jumped on a bus to Sao Paulo from which we would head to the coast and Ilha Grande (proc. Granje).

We arrived in the early evening in a town called Pariti where we would sleep for the night before getting up early in order to get to the port from which we could get to Ilha Grande. Although the boat wasnt until the afternoon, England were playing and we couldnt miss that! That afternoon we caught the boat and found somewhere to stay.

That was yesterday, today the weather was amazing and so we spent the day lounging on the beach and the sun terrace of the hostel. To top off the incredible weather and the scenery we saw a couple of turtles swimming around serenly in the bay.

Tomorrow its more beaches or lagoons and then we head to Rio. We only have 2 days there before we fly home on Monday!

Im sorry that this is a bit rushed and possibly not well written but I had a few moments while Katie is at the shops and wanted to fill you all with what we have been doing.

Hope you are all well and look forward to seeing everyone soon.

Take care

Chris and Katie
