Hello!

Happy Easter everyone! We are missing the millions of Easter eggs we are normally lucky enough to receive but still having a good time! We have bought each other a creme egg so we feel Easter-y but as for big eggs, there are sooo many better ways to spend our money so we held back.

We have been up to loads of stuff since I last wrote but I will try to keep it shortish for those of you who are meant to be studying and finding any excuse to put it off! Hope you&#8217;re all ok and not too stressed!

So the first day in Byron we went on a trip to a place called Nimbin-honestly the strangest place I have ever been! Everybody who lives in that town is constantly high on weed, the shops only sell rainbow coloured clothing and items with the cannabis leaf on and a lot of people have dreadlocks. The police ignore it for the sake of tourism and since they would have to arrest the whole town otherwise. We then went to a nice waterfall and spent the afternoon there jumping in off the rocks and chilling out. The next day was awesome-we went kayaking with dolphins in the morning and then had a surf lesson in the afternoon. We saw dolphins and they took photos which we still need to download from there website-hopefully there are some of the dolphins. Chris was a bit of a pro at the surfing, up first time. I took 2 attempts but was standing up and having an awesome time!

We then left Byron and went up to Brisbane via surfers paradise which had big waves and was a nice beach but nothing to special. In Brisbane we chilled out in the botanical gardens and in a strange fake beach they had made in the city!? In the afternoon we met up with our friend Staffy (we met him in Vietnam) and he took us Rock Climbing with his friends which was really good fun. Again Chris was a pro, easily the best apart from Staffy and in fact Staffy could only just get slightly higher than Chris did. I however was not so good, maybe the worst-but it was still good fun.

The next day we went to Moreton Island which is the 2nd biggest sand Island and was beautiful. It&#8217;s home to 8/10 most deadly snake and 7/10 most deadly spiders-luckily we saw none! We went sandboarding there and were taken on a tour round the island in a 4&#215;4 16 seater bus! We also saw some turtles swimming in the sea and a lake which was red as the tea tree from the trees gets in it-it looked strange!

The next day we went to Australia zoo (steve Irwins zoo) which was really good. We saw the crocodile show where the guy feeds the crocodile in the arena with him-scary. We also fed and stroked the kangaroos, patted koalas and fed elephants again. We had a really good day there.

We stayed in Noosa which was another nice beach and then the next day we drove up to rainbow beach, again a nice beach but we were there for one thing and one thing only-FRASER ISLAND! And fraser island did not disappoint! We had an awesome 3 days there with a great group of people. There were 8 of us in the 4&#215;4, only 3 of us could drive it though but fraser is the largest sand island in the world so driving it was difficult but great fun! We went to beautiful lake Mackenzie on the first day. Second day we drove up to the shipwreck and then up to Indian head which had great views down the coastline and we saw stingrays in the sea. We then went to the Champagne pools which are big rock pools. I saw a turtle there and Giorgia from our group saw a shark. In fact you wern&#8217;t allowed in the sea on this island because of the sharks. The final day we went to Eli creek, a little knee height river. We saw a massive spider and Alex saw an eel in the river but it was pretty and we walked down it anyway. There were also millions of baby frogs-cute! We then went to Lake Wabby which was also stunning. There were loads of catfish in the water which was cool. We love Fraser and had such a good time with our group there!

The last two days we have really just been driving, but we are now in Airlie and tomorrow we start our sailing trip around the whitsundays which we are both really looking forward too!!

Ok so that was longer than I expected, I hope you guys are ok and life is good for you guys back home. Hope the Blakes are having fun in Scotland-we want to know all about your trip too (postcard not expected).

Take care and have a good Easter.

Miss you all lots and love you lots

Katie and Chris

p.s Thinking of all of you who have finals studying hard-high five for you!
