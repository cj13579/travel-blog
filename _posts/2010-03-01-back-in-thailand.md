Hi guys!

Hope everyone is well and the snow has finally stopped for you all. We are still having a brilliant time and have chilled out a lot more since being in Thailand.

We went straight to Chaing Mai and did an awesome trek with our guesthouse who took us to near the burmese border where some of the family live and we had a great time learning local dances and playing football against the hill tribe (they won but Chris&#8217;s goalkeeping was surprisingly VERY good &#8211; hidden talent). The elephant trekking was sooooo good and the elephants seemed sooo happy. There were 3 owned by a family and a dad and 2 sons were riding them with us on as well. Our elephant was called Meh and she kept splashing us with water and then flapping her ears which means they are happy. It was really incredible. Infact the whole trek and bamboo rafting was really good.

The next few days we just chilled out by the pool and wondered around Chaing Mai and went to lots of awesome night markets. We also kept going back to Archers &#8211; a bar ran by an English guy (Mark) and his Thai wife (Sa) who were lovely. It was his birthday while we were there so we went to his little party thing and had a really good night. We also went to the tiger temple which is contraversial. We wern&#8217;t going to go but Mark pursuaded us to as all the volunteers swear they are not drugged. I&#8217;m still not convinced either way but we had a good day and the tigers did seem well looked after and happy. We also hired a moped one day and drove up this mountain to waterfalls and temples. Chris loved the ride, windy and hilly.

We then flew down to Phuket where we stayed for one night and it was a bit of a dive as we went to phuket town where our boat departed rather than the touristy beachy area patong. But the next day we left to Koh Phi Phi which was beautiful. The inhabitable area is very small though so it was very busy but we did our diving course there which was just unbeleivable! Chris has already told yoou about it so I won&#8217;t go on too much but we had such a wicked time and had lunch in maya bay from the film the beach which was stunning and just saw sooooo much!!

We then headed to Krabi for a night which was nice and had an awesome cheap market with great food. The next day we headed striaght to Koh sok national park which was beautiful and we spent the day walking round and stopping at waterfalls and pools you could swim in. The scenery was phenominal but the walk was long -18km and quite challenging, but good fun all the same. We had a great day excpet Chris almost fell off a cliff but managed to only cut his toes! phew!

After the national park we headed to Koh Tao, a beautiful island which we fell in love with maybe for all the wrong reasons. We spent 4 days just lying on the beach with a group of people we met on the boat there and had some aweome nights out there. And it really was just a chilled out place, not as busy as Koh Phi Phi.

Now we are at Koh Phangan. Our accomadation here is really nice! We have a private beach and pool and the comfiest bed ever! The first day was spent by the pool but yesterday we hired a moped and drove round the island which was cool. I had my first go at moped riding and only had one slight incident, I wasn&#8217;t stopping as fast as I wanted so put my foot on the floor &#8211; error &#8211; and cut my toe pretty badly, but after a bit of first aid from doctor Chris I got back on and was fine, although I didn&#8217;t try any of the steep hills on the island &#8211; I left them to the now expert of mountain motorbiking!

Last night we went out to Haad Rin  for the night before full moon party which was an incredible night! We met back up with the group from Koh Tao and just had the best time. However that means today is a bit of a write off &#8211; we&#8217;ve got up and spent an hour by the pool and expect that will be the stopry of the day &#8211; maybe the private beach. Tonight is the full moon party and seeing as there were over 5000 people there yesterday tonight is going to be mad!!!

Anyways I feel like I&#8217;m rambling now but in short we&#8217;re still having an awesome time and feel like we&#8217;ve calmed down a bit now which is nice after lots of moving. Tommorrow we leave to Lang Kawi, Malaysia which should be good. So still lots to look forward to.

We still miss you all and hope everything is ok at home! Hope you&#8217;re enjoying the pictures too.

Lots of love to you all!!!

Katie and Chris.
